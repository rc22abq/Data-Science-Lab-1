    "Look at the `vertebrate.csv` file. In this data set, each vertebrate is classified into one of 5 categories: mammals, reptiles, birds, fishes, and amphibians, based on a set of explanatory attributes (predictor variables). Except for \"name\", the rest of the attributes have been converted into a binary representation. To illustrate this, we will first load the data into a Pandas DataFrame object and display its content."
